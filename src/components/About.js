      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a <strong>passionate</strong>, <strong>self-disciplined</strong>, <strong>dedicated</strong> &amp; <strong>self-taught</strong> developer with the goal of pursuing a
        career in professional software development. I am always improving myself via coding
        challenges, reading Medium and dev.to articles, and contributing to the success of my colleagues.

        Back in the undergraduate university days, coding was a hobby that I enjoyed in my free time. 
        The satisfaction of creating cool features and solving problems with code is euphoric. 
        Then one day, I decided it's time to turn my hobby into a career. 
        I grew a passion for modern web development - both backend and frontend - after I learned 
        JavaScript, React, NodeJS, and the various innovative libraries that supplement these development technologies. 
        In the future, I will expand my passion to native mobile apps and beyond once I get the proper development hardware to do so.

        When I am not at my computer, I am either enjoying nature, caring for my pets, working out at a gym, or listening to indie music.
