          <h1 className="font-bold">Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Albert</h1>
          <p>
            I am a web and native app developer with experience across various modern web technologies.
            My expertise lies primarily in the Javascript ecosystem,
            specifically with React, React Native, and the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently in an apprenticeship program at Alpha Works Tech - Bitwise Industries,
            where I collaborate with my team or various teams to design, prototype, build, and deploy
            functional apps to production.
          </p>
